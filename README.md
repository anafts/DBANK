### ⚠️ Prerequisites:

You will also need  Install and Setup internet Computer Web3 Application Development. 
Furthermore. It's good to work with a good text editor as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

<br>

### 🔧 Installation and usage:

```bash

# Clone the project
 $ git clone https://github.com/anafts/DBANK.git

# Access the project folder in terminal/cmd
 $ cd DBANK

# install the dependencies
 $ npm install

```

### ⚙️ Running the project locally:

If you want to test the project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
 $ dfx start 

# Deploys the canisters to the replica and generates the candid interface
 $ dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, the application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai`. 


Additionally, if you make frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.
